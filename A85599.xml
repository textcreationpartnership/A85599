            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>There was a Meſſenger taken with letters to Colonell <hi>Horton</hi> by the <hi>Welch,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tryed by a Councell of Warre many would have had him hanged; But one of them ſtepped up and ſaid, that it would bee a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:161649:3"/>bad example, and ſo he was onely kept pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner untill hee purchaſed his liberty.</p>
            <p>Colonel <hi>Powel,</hi> upon the advance of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Horton</hi> tooke an a Alarme, and placed ſeverall parties, to keep ſome paſſes, whilſt he retreated with his whole Army, And di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Bridges were broken downe in ſeverall places to ſtop the Engliſh from comming upon them.</p>
            <p>Colonel <hi>Horton</hi> beate up ſome quarters, and took ſome ſtraglers, and faced the whole Army divers dayes.</p>
            <p>But the Welch were gotten upon the top of a large Hill, to which they came: The Engliſh would have drawn them downe, but they would not, but ſtood to their ground though they were faced in ſeverall places.</p>
            <p>Colonel <hi>Horton</hi> adviſed with his Officers whether he ſhould march up the Hil to force them to ingage, but it was not thought fit to doe ſo, becauſe it would give too much advantage.</p>
            <p>Then the Engliſh wheeld off, ſuppoſing that that might allure them to fall upon the reare, and ſo get them to ingage, But ſtill the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:161649:4"/>Welch kept the Hill, and would not come downe.</p>
            <p>Then Colonell <hi>Horton</hi> ſent Colonel Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a party of Horſe and Dragoones to gaine a paſſe on the other ſide of the Army, ſome ſeaven miles from his owne Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>The party that marched with him on his deſigne, were two Companies of Dragoones and one Troope of Horſe.</p>
            <p>As ſoone as ere the Engliſh approached, the Welch quit the paſſe, and retreated to their Army, and gave them an Alarme on that ſide.</p>
            <p>Then Collonell <hi>Powell</hi> ſent out a forlorne hope, commanded by Major <hi>Roach</hi> to oppoſe Collonell <hi>Fleming,</hi> both parties met and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, and the fight was but ſhort, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſharp, and divers of the Welch was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſome ſlaine, And the whole Forlorne Hope totally routed, which was purſued ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry farre into the welch quarters, And no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve or releife heere Collonell <hi>Fleming</hi> who had then taken many priſoners.</p>
            <p>Then Collonell <hi>Butler</hi> was ſent up from
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:161649:4"/>Colonell <hi>Powell</hi> with a reſerve to the <hi>Welch,</hi> who Ambuſcado'd the way, and whilſt the Engliſh were in purſuit, riſe upon them, and ſo over-powred them, that they were al for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to fly and ſhift for themſelves, leaving moſt of their Horſes behind them.</p>
            <p>Yet divers of the <hi>Welch</hi> were ſlaine, and many wounded; And of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> there were four killed, And Captain <hi>Molineux</hi> ſhot through the thigh.</p>
            <p>Collonel <hi>Fleming</hi> with 119 more got into a Church which they kept againſt them a while, but after a parly agreed to ſurrender upon quarter of their lives. But gallant, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Collonell <hi>Fleming</hi> is ſlaine, by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy accident with a Piſtoll in his owne hand.</p>
            <p>Collonell <hi>Horton</hi> hath ſent a Drummer to Collonell <hi>Powell,</hi> for exchange of priſoners, for he hath about 50 priſoners (and ſome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſiderable ones) beſides thoſe that were taken before he came into theſe parts, and he endevours daily to give them battle.</p>
            <p>They give out in the Welch quarters; that the King is to come to <hi>London;</hi> That Biſhops
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:161649:5"/>are eſtabliſhed, and the Book of Common Prayer ſet up againe, in all parts about <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> And that the City of <hi>London</hi> have cut off thouſands of the Army, and other ſuch like fictions they ſpread abroad, to animate the people to comply with them.</p>
            <p>Here is a great deſire that ſome eminent Commander would come with additionall ſtrength, becauſe Collonell <hi>Horton</hi> hath his health very ill.</p>
